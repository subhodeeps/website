# Week 23, 2025 (Jun 2 - Jun 8)

Well, my activity on this site has been a rotter for the past few months. It's not that I haven't been doing anything, but I just haven't been documenting it on this site. A lot of things have been happening, but more on them maybe sometime later. For now, let me share what I did this week!


1. Solved 5 [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/) problems. These have been pretty fun and also good exercises for my brain. I'm planning to do 1 problem each day from here.

2. Made my first open-source contribution :) well, although it wasn't much, it was a nice feeling. I basically submitted a solution to the Deep-ML repository. Hasn't been accepted yet, but I did what I could, so it's all good.

3. Gotten quite faimilar with RNNs and ConvNets. These were my main focus over the past week or so. I've written some (crude) code snippets on [this](https://github.com/sumitdotml/deep-learning) GitHub repo.

4. Also learned some C++! I've really wanted to start learning this language for quite a while, and over the last week, I finally made some fundamental strides. I've done a bit of the usual stuff (like cin, cout, vector, how compiling works, separating modules and headers, and so on). I plan to do a little bit of this every week as well. Maybe I should also try solving the Deep-ML problems in C++ once I do that in Python (maybe). Should be fun!

5. Also, my 2nd week in a row of using solely neovim for everything! Even now, this is currently being written on my mac mini's website directory through a ssh connection from my other macbook :) so much fun to be able to control my mac mini remotely haha (I learned how to do this this week as well!)

I think this is the gist of it for this week. Will be documenting my learning on this site regularly from here onwards :) will also start writing a lot more blogs; can't be slacking off too much!!!

See you soon!
