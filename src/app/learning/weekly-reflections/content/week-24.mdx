# Week 24, 2025 (Jun 9 - Jun 15)

So, this week has been pretty busy for me in terms of work, and it brings no joy in admitting this but I had to do plenty of overtime work because of the current status of my team's project. I was handed out the biggest task I have ever been since I started working here, and it's been quite exciting but -- given the scale -- also quite challenging.

One takeaway from this: I love programming, but I despise writing tests.

For my weekly learning, I did try what I could, but personally, I think this has been an underwhelming one. Here's what I can all think of:

- I've been trying to code a simple transformer using pure [Tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad). I have gotten into this habit lately of watching George Hotz streams and the way he programs, and I've kinda wanted to contribute to Tinygrad for a bit, so thought this would be a good way to get used to the library. Read some docs, watched some streams. Haven't completed writing the transformer yet ([current  progress](https://github.com/sumitdotml/transformer-with-tinygrad/)), but should be done soon. Frankly, think I've been a bit lazy. Not good enough.

- Solved 2 [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/) problems. Been very fun, but I was supposed to do one each day... not good enough.

- Studied KV Cache via the latest KV Cache pull request I saw in the [nanoVLM](https://github.com/huggingface/nanoVLM) repository. They're doing pretty good out there. Their [KV Cache blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/kv-cache) is pretty nice.

- Coded a tic-tac-toe game in C++. This... does not sound very impressive but well, it did take me a little bit to craft the storing & pattern matching logic in this language. Was super fun.

... and that's pretty much it.

I saw that Sebastian Raschka dropped a new Substack post about coding KV Cache from scratch, so I'll do that this upcoming week. And among other things. See you next week!
